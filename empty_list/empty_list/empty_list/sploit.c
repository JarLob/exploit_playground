      // to the kalloc.16 zone. So it's unlucky for this bug, but it has to cope with it and work on an extremely busy kalloc.16 zone.
      
      // It looks like a very interesting(and at the same time, painstaking) task to enhance the reliability here, because I've experienced a few pretty exotic situations
      // in the past and had to think of creative ways to overcome them(such as 2 threads racing where I don't have any control to interfere, and both of them race-heap-feng-shuing
      // on the same heap where one of them is overflowing continuosly, and requiring the process to survive while succeeding in the overflow into the target object).
      
      // One thing that I might have tried is the "zalloc() timing attack" presented 3 years ago from Luca Todesco. It could help narrow down the range of the last kalloc.16 chunk on the page,
      // and also the range of target ipc_port(assuming the zalloc() timing attack still works). If it does work, then I think it could also be used to determine when exactly the
      // CPU has handed over execution to another task.

      // Or another way is to just carefully place "sched_yield()" in the right locations within this loop, because we know when exactly free-alloc-overflow-free-fill happens on
      // these lines of code, so we could actually draw out all possible scenarios where a rogue kalloc.16 allocation will race in and leave a free block in one of the kalloc.16
      // chunks. If we're lucky, just fiddling around with sched_yield() here and there would do the trick.

      // Or maybe... let's say there's a "free chunk storage spot" called FCP. We will spray a bunch of kalloc.16 chunks way early in the beginning of the sploit, and call this FCP.
      // We could determine by empirical testing on the minimum schedule slice that this exploit task will be given. We will place several "sched_yield()"s so every code block
      // between those "sched_yield()"s will be executed within that minimum schedule slice. Now before executing each "sched_yield()", we would deliberately free a couple chunks(let's say 10)
      // inside FCP so they will be added to the freelist. The reason why we're doing this is to take care of rougue kalloc.16 allocations created by other processes.
      // When the other process allocates a rogue kalloc.16, it will pick up a free block within FCP. It could probably free it right away, or hold on to it for a little bit. When our
      // exploit task picks the CPU back up, first thing it'll do is spray 10+5 kalloc.16 blocks. This will not interfere with our middle_kallocs, because there are no free holes
      // within them(actually, there are holes for very brief moments. Maybe placing sched_yield() just before the creation of those free holes would work). So basically, it's
      // a placeholder free chunk storage technique that could cope with rougue allocations.

      // Or maybe... you could just let the spinners constantly spray kalloc.16 chunks only when the master loop is running. This will drasitically reduce the success rate of
      // overflow into ipc_port, but at the same time it reduces rougue kalloc.16 chunks landing into the middle_kallocs. Usually when I approached a problem this way, there
      // was a "sweet spot" where the success rate is high enough, and the fail rate is low enough. This kind of sweet spot technique is good for POCs, but you would have to
      // tinker with it on every different device, and also it could change when the device is busy(listening to music), so it's not recommended...

      // Another way to rely on luck is to just increase the number of spinner threads by ten fold. Maybe that would make all the rogue allocations go away out of pure serendipity!

      // Assuming this problem is solved, there is another problem. What if ipc_port page is not right after kalloc.16...? It could happen. Allocations from other processes could
      // have filled up the freelist and create a new page right after our middle_kalloc page. If we were to overflow into that page and the first chunk in that page contains a
      // free chunk or a critical object(i.e. first QWORD is vtable), then the kernel will panic. This problem is luckily easily solvable, with a bit of work. First, we need to
      // assume that any chunk of any size could create that rougue page. We could, for instance, use the above mentioned FCP technique. Create a loooooooooooooong freelist for every
      // single kalloc.X that exists in the system(we could probably leave a single allocation in every page for the page to not be garbage collected), and then finally initiate
      // the heap grooming. Now, any interfering kallocs that are not kalloc.16 or ipc_port will be placed inside that placeholder freelink, and not disturb during the
      // heap grooming process. It doesn't really matter if the rougue pages get created *after* the interleaving page heap grooming, cause all that's important is the kalloc.16 and
      // ipc_port page order. During the overflow loop, the other allocations don't interfere in any way. Only the rougue kalloc.16 allocations are deleterious during this loop.
      
      // So yeah, you need to deal with these problems 1. rougue kalloc.16 alloc/free during this loop. 2. Other allocations that would mess up the page order.
      // While solving these 2 problems, problem 3 might pop up. And problem 4 too...
      
      // All of this requires a lot of empirical testing until you find a method that is reliable enough. To debug this, I would first get the kernel task port with this exploit,
      // and then I would re-do this whole process right after this loop excluding the overflow part and replacing it with just a kalloc/free, then read kernel memory with
      // the kernel task port and check if the allocation order is always the same. I would introduce fixes based on the above ideas or other new ideas if there is a messup,
      // then I would re-check it, and this cycle will go on and on until the allocation order is always the same for like 50 iterations. I would do the same to solve the
      // rogue kalloc.16 problem. Also, I would check if the zalloc timing attack still works because it would serve as a useful tool for various purposes.

      // But still, the best way would be to totally avoid these problems altogether by using a completely different exploitation technique.(Find a kalloc.16 object where if
      // the first 8 bytes are wiped out to NULL, then something useful happens...?)
