# About #

This is where I will post analysis of Public Exploits, or some of my 1day exploits.

About one day exploits :
- Personally I think the best way to learn a public exploit is by understanding it line-by-line until I can understand the exploit to the fullest. I will post some of these (overly-commented ;) ) exploits so hopefully others can learn from it.


### CVE-2016-8655

* This is a detailed analysis of [rebel's exploit](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/621).
* Thanks **rebel** for the awesome exploit! :D

### CVE-2016-5342
#### mp3 version
* This is a commented version of [freener's android LPE exploit](https://github.com/freener/exploits/blob/master/CVE-2016-5342/exploit_mp3_bypass_pxn.c)
* arm32
* Heap overflow
* This exploit directly overwrites a function pointer of another object

#### tty version
* This is a commented version of [freener's android LPE exploit](https://github.com/freener/exploits/blob/master/CVE-2016-5342/exploit_tty_bypass_pxn.c)
* arm32
* Heap overflow
* This exploit overwrites an object pointer in another object. It uses ret2dir attack to make the corrupted pointer point to a predictable fixed address in kernel which holds the exploit payload. This exploit technique bypasses PXN & PAN.

### CVE-2016-2434
* This is a commented version of [Jianqiang Zhao's android LPE exploit](https://github.com/jianqiangzhao/CVE-2016-2434)
* arm64
* Zero-out 16 bytes at an arbitrary address
* This exploit wipes out 16 bytes of a useful global object, which is located at a fixed address in kernel.
* A corrupted object pointer within the global object references exploit payload from userland. This kind of attack will not work on devices/kernels with PAN(or PAN emulation).
